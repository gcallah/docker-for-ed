            Docker for Education
        </h1>

        <p>
            Docker has great potential for use in education, 
            potential that has hardly been exploited at this point.
            From stable and consistent setups for program development
            to "networks" running entirely on a laptop, we
            believe that Docker can ease the burden on computer
            science educators.
