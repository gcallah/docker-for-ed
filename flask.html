<h1>
    Docker for Flask Applications
</h1>

<h4>Access flask server from within docker container</h4>

<p>Change the host that flask is running on to '0.0.0.0'. The localhost in the container is local only to the container, not to your computer:</p>
<p><code>flask run -h 0.0.0.0</code></p>
<p>This will bind the app to all network interfaces on the container and will be reachable by your machine</p>
<h4>Why Is LocalHost Unreachable?</h4>
<p>Docker containers are their own little self-contained networks. They have an external interface, eth0, they have an external ip address, they have routing tables, and a localhost. Localhost doesn't map to an external interface, and it's generally bad practice to try to do so.</p>
<p>Let's take a simple container as an example, I'll just run a linux container like so:</p>
<p>docker run -it ubuntu bash
Now I can check out the network details inside that container by running apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install net-tools:</p>
<pre><code>ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 172.17.0.2  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
        ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 11286  bytes 16471897 (16.4 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 3421  bytes 189224 (189.2 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING&gt;  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        loop  txqueuelen 1  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre>
<p><code>lo</code> is loopback, or localhost. It's a completely separate interface and is not externally facing, eth0, however, is. You can bind to it, but I wouldn't guarantee that the ip address is the same all the time.</p>
<p>So the easiest way is to bind flask to all of them.</p>
<p><code>loopback</code> is simply for the network to communicate with itself, nothing more. It doesn't need to have an externally facing component, because by design it's not intended for external communication</p>
